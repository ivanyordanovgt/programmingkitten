- 👋 Hi, I’m @programmingkitten, i study coding since i was 12 (I am 17 right now). I started with batch and vbs for some random 'viruses' like programs. Then i moved to AutoHotkey script to
create scripts for games. Then i started studying a lot of languages to find the one i love the most. I tried C#, C++, php and many other and found
that i like Python the most. I realised coding is my real passion and i love doing it so i started studying at softuni and after 2 years I managed to graduate with an 
avarage score of 5.93.

- 👀 I’m interested in web devolpement. I love it. It's very fun and you see the progress instantly. Which motivates you A LOT. Even the slightest change makes me
feel awesome and that i can do even more. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning NODE.JS at softuni.bg.  

- 💞️ Im looking to work for a team that uses Django or NODE.JS. I am very good at team work and i love to communicate.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
